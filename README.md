🚀 The "Glassmorphic" Launch Card

Most business cards are static; this one is a conversion engine. Built for my coding class, this project bridges the gap between clean frontend engineering and high-impact product marketing.

### ✨ Why it stands out:

- **The "Vibe":** Uses **2026 Glassmorphism** (frosted glass) and a high-contrast palette to move away from "basic" corporate styles and toward a premium SaaS aesthetic.
- **Engineered for Action:** The "Tiger Flame" CTA isn't just a button—it’s built with **layered glow effects** and **cubic-bezier transitions** to drive "click-through" intent.
- **The T-PMM Mindset:** I established a visual hierarchy that anchors on the value proposition (_"Bridging the gap..."_) before leading the user to the conversion point.

### 🛠 The Tech Specs:

- **CSS Architecture:** Custom variables, pseudo-element glows, and `backdrop-filter` blurs.
- **UX-First Approach:** Focused on vertical rhythm, "breathable" white space, and interactive status indicators.
